\begin{document}
A \emph{transition event} (or simply \emph{event}) on a state set $S$ is an element $e = (s_i, s_j) \in (S\times S)$ of a binary relation on state set $S$ that signifies the transition from one state to another.  An event $e$ is defined by a condition function $c(s_i)$ which evaluates a Boolean function in state $s_i$ and by an action function $p$.
