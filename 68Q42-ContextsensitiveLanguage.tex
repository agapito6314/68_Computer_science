\begin{document}
A \emph{context-sensitive language} is a language over some alphabet generated by generated by some \PMlinkescapetext{grammar} known as a \emph{context-sensitive grammar}.

Formally, a \emph{context-sensitive language} is a formal grammar $G=(\Sigma, N, P, \sigma)$, such that given any production in $P$, it
\begin{enumerate}
\item either has the form $$uXv\to uwv,$$ where $X\in N$, $u,v,w\in \Sigma^*$, and $w\ne \lambda$, the empty word,
\item or is $\sigma\to \lambda$, provided that the start symbol $\sigma$ does not occur on the right side of any productions in $P$. 
\end{enumerate}
In other words, if $G$ does not contain the production $\sigma\to \lambda$, then any production will have the form in condition 1.  On the other hand, if $G$ does contain $\sigma\to \lambda$, then for any production $uXv\to uwv$ of $G$, $\sigma$ does not occur in $uwv$.  

The reason for including the second condition is to ensure the possibility that $\lambda$ may be generated by the grammar.

One may interpret the first condition as follows: the non-terminal symbol $X$ can only be transformed into the word $w$ if it is surrounded by $u$ and $v$, or that it is in the ``context'' of $uXv$.  If in each production $uXv\to uwv$ of $G$, $u=v=\lambda$, (so that $X$ no longer has a ``context''), then $G$ is a context-free grammar.

Given a context-sensitive grammar $G$, the \emph{context-sensitive language} generated by $G$ is $L(G)$.  In other words, $$L(G):=\lbrace v\in T^*\mid \sigma\stackrel{*}{\to} v\rbrace,$$
where $T=\Sigma-N$ is the set of terminals, and $\sigma\stackrel{*}{\to} v$ means that the word $v$ over $\Sigma$ is produced after a finite number of applications of the productions in $P$ to $\sigma$.  

With condition 2, we see that a context-sensitive language contains $\lambda$ iff it is generated by a context-sensitive grammar containing $\sigma\to \lambda$.  With condition 2, every context-free language is context-sensitive.  Without condition 2, every $\lambda$-free context-free language is $\lambda$-free context-sensitive.  

$\lbrace a^nb^nc^n \mid n\ge 0\rbrace$ and $\lbrace a^{2^n} \mid n\ge 0 \rbrace$ are examples of context-sensitive languages that are not context-free, the second of which is $\lambda$-free.

\textbf{Remarks}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
A formal grammar $G$ is said to be \emph{length-increasing} if for every production $U\to V$ of $G$, the length of $U$ is at most the length of $V$: $|U|\le |V|$.  Every context-sensitive grammar not containing $\sigma\to \lambda$ (condition 2) is length-increasing.  Conversely, any language generated by a length-increasing grammar is context-sensitive.
\item
The minimal automaton required for processing a context-sensitive languages is a bounded non-deterministic Turing machine (bounded linear automaton).
\item 
The family of context-sensitive languages has the following closure properties: union, intersection, concatenation, Kleene star, reversal, and complementation (proved in 1988).  It is not closed under homomorphism.
\item
In the Chomsky hierarchy, context-sensitive grammars are at Level 1.  In fact, every context-sensitive language is recursive.  The converse is not true, however.
\item
Given a context-sensitive language $L$ and a word $w$, it is decidable whether $w\in L$.
