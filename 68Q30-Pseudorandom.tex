\begin{document}
A distribution ensemble $\{D_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is \emph{pseudorandom} if it is computationally indistinguishable from the ensemble $\{U_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ where each $U_n$ is the uniform distribution on the support of $D_n$.  That is, no reasonable procedure can make meaningful predictions about what element will be chosen.
