If $R$ is a binary relation such that $\operatorname{field}(R)\subseteq\Gamma^+$ and $T$ is a Turing machine, then $T$ \emph{calculates} $f$ if:

\begin{itemize}
\item If $x$ is such that there is some $y$ such that $R(x,y)$ then $T$ accepts $x$ with output $z$ such that $R(x,z)$ (there may be multiple $y$, and $T$ need only find one of them)

\item If $x$ is such that there is no $y$ such that $R(x,y)$ then $T$ rejects $x$
\end{itemize}

Note that the \PMlinkescapetext{graph} of a partial function is a binary relation, and if $T$ calculates a partial function then there is at most one possible output.

A \PMlinkescapetext{relation} $R$ can be viewed as a \emph{search problem}, and a Turing machine which calculates $R$ is also said to solve it.  Every search problem has a corresponding decision problem, namely $L(R)=\{x\mid \exists y R(x,y)\}$.

This definition may be generalized to $n$-ary relations using any suitable encoding which allows multiple strings to be compressed into one string (for instance by listing them consecutively with a delimiter).
