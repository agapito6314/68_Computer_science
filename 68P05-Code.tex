\begin{document}
Let $A$ be an alphabet.  A \emph{code over $A$} is any subset $C$ of the set of words $A^*$ on the alphabet $A$ such that $C$ has ``uniquue factorization into letters,'' i.e., such that for whenever $a_1\ldots a_n=b_1\ldots b_m$, with all $a_i,b_j\in C$, then we have $n=m$ and $a_i=b_i$ for all $i$. In other words, every ``word over $A$'' generated by $C$ (considered as an alphabet) can be uniquely factored into ``letters'' in C.  

An example of a subset of $A^*$ which is \emph{not} a code is given by $C=\lbrace ab, c, a, bc \rbrace$. Here the word $abc$ can be written either as $(ab)c$ or as $a(bc)$ in terms of elements of $C$. Since $ab \ne a$ nor $c\ne bc$, $C$ is not a code.

If we fix a length $n$ for the words, i.e. we require that $C\subset A^n$, then we call $C$ a \emph{block code}, and call $n$ the \emph{block length} of the code.  An important property of a code is the code's \emph{minimum distance}, given by the minimum Hamming distance between any pair of words in $C$.

This notion of code is obviously very general.  In practice (i.e., in coding theory) one typically takes codes with a little more structure.  See, in particular, linear codes.
