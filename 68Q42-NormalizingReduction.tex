\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a set and $\rightarrow$ a reduction (binary relation) on $X$. An element \(x \in X\) is said to be in \emph{normal form} with respect to $\rightarrow$ if \(x \nrightarrow y\) for all \(y \in X\), i.e., if there is no \(y \in X\) such that \(x \rightarrow y\). Equivalently, $x$ is in normal form with respect to $\to$ iff $x\notin \operatorname{dom}(\to)$.  To be \emph{irreducible} is a common synonym for `to be in normal form'.
  
Denote by $\stackrel{*}{\rightarrow}$ the reflexive transitive closure of $\rightarrow$. An element \(y \in X\) is said to be \emph{a normal form of} \(x \in X\) if $y$ is in normal form and \(x \stackrel{*}{\rightarrow} y\).

A reduction $\to$ on $X$ is said to be \emph{normalizing} if every element $x\in X$ has a normal form.
\end{definition}

\textbf{Examples}.  
\begin{itemize}
\item
Let $X$ be any set.  Then no elements in $X$ are in normal form with respect to any reduction that is either reflexive.  If $\to$ is a symmetric relation, then $x\in X$ is in normal form with respect to $\to$ iff $x$ is not in the domain (or range) of $\to$.
\item
Let $X=\lbrace a,b,c,d\rbrace$ and $\to = \lbrace (a,a),(a,b),(a,c),(b,c),(a,d)\rbrace$.  Then $c$ and $d$ are both in normal form.  In addition, they are both normal forms of $a$, while $d$ is a normal form only for $a$.  However, $X$ is not normalizing because neither $c$ nor $d$ have normal forms.
\item
Let $X$ be the set of all positive integers greater than $1$.  Define the reduction $\to$ on $X$ as follows: $a\to b$ if there is an element $c\in X$ such that $a=bc$.  Then it is clear that every prime number is in normal form.  Furthermore, every element $x$ in $X$ has $n$ normal forms, where $n$ is the number of prime divisors of $x$.  Clearly, $n\ge 1$ for every $x\in X$.  As a result, $X$ is normalizing.
