\begin{document}
Given a stack, the act of adding a new element to the top of the stack is to \emph{push} an element onto it. If there is a stack pointer, it would be incremented (or decremented if the bottom element of the stack is placed at the highest memory address available).

To do this to a queue is usually called to \emph{enqueue}.
