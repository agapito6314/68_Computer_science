\begin{document}
The invariance theorem states that a universal Turing machine provides an 
optimal means of description, up to a constant. Formally, for every 
Turing machine $M$ there exists a constant $c$ such that for
all binary strings $x$ we have \[C_U(x) \leq C_M(x) + c.\]
Here, $C_U$ means the complexity with respect to the universal
Turing machine and $C_M$ means the complexity with respect to $M$.

This follows trivially from the definition of a universal Turing machine,
taking $c = l(<M>)$ as the length of the encoding of $M$.

The invariance theorem holds likewise for prefix and conditional complexities.
