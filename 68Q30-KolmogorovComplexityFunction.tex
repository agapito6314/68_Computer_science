The (plain) complexity $C(x)$ of a binary string $x$ is the length of a shortest
program $p$ such that $U(p)=x$, i.e. the (plain) universal Turing machine on
input $p$, outputs $x$ and halts. The lexicographically least such $p$ is
denoted $x^{\ast}$.
The prefix complexity $K(x)$ is defined similarly in terms of the prefix universal
machine. When clear from context, $x^{\ast}$ is also used to denote the
lexicographically least prefix program for $x$.

Plain and prefix conditional complexities $C(x|y), K(x|y)$ are defined similarly
but with $U(x|y)=x$, i.e. the universal machine starts out with $y$ written
on its worktape.

Subscripting these functions with a Turing machine $M$, as in
$K_M(x|y)$, denotes the corresponding complexity in which we use machine $M$
in place of the universal machine $U$.
