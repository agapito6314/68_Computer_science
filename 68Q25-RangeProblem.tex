\begin{document}
A \emph{range problem} is a weakened form of a search problem.  It consists of two functions $f_l$ and $f_u$ (the lower and upper bounds) and a linear ordering $<$ on the ranges of $f_1$ and $f_2$.  A Turing machine solves a range problem if, for any $x$, the machine eventually halts with an output $y$ such that $f_1(x)<y<f_2(x)$.

For example, given any function $f$ with range in $\mathbb{R}$ and any $g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, the \emph{strong range problem} $\operatorname{StrongRange}_g(f)$ is given by lower bound $f(x)\cdot(1-\frac{1}{1-g(|x|)})$ and upper bound $f(x)\cdot(1-\frac{1}{1+g(|x|)})$ (note that $g$ is passed the length of $x$, not the value, which need not even be a number).
