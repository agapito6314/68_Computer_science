\begin{document}
If one has some data that needs to be sorted or indexed, the \emph{key}
is the part of the data that is used to make comparisons (if sorting) or to enter
into the \PMlinkescapetext{index}. 

For example, if one has a list of people the \PMlinkescapetext{field} in the data might be 
names and addresses. One might sort by last name as a key or by street address
as another key.
