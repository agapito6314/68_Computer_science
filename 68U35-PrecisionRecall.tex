\begin{document}
In information retrieval, precision and recall are the fundamental parameters defining the behavior of an information retrieval system. Precision is defined as the proportion of relevant documents in the set of all documents returned by a search. Recall is defined as the number of relevant documents retrieved as fraction of all relevant documents.
