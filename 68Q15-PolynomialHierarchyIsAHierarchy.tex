The polynomial hierarchy is a hierarchy.  Specifically: \[\Sigma^p_i\cup\Pi^p_i\subseteq\Delta^p_{i+1}\subseteq\Sigma^p_{i+1}\cap\Pi^p_{i+1}.\]

\section*{Proof}

To see that $\Sigma^p_i\cup\Pi^p_i\subseteq\Delta^p_{i+1}=\mathcal{P}^{\Sigma^p_i}$, 
observe that the machine which checks its input against its oracle and accepts or rejects when the oracle accepts or rejects (respectively) is easily in $\mathcal{P}$, as is the machine which rejects or accepts when the oracle accepts or rejects (respectively).  These easily emulate $\Sigma^p_i$ and $\Pi^p_i$ respectively.

Since $\mathcal{P}\subseteq\mathcal{NP}$, it is clear that 
$\Delta^p_i\subseteq\Sigma^p_i$.  Since $\mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{C}}$ is 
closed 
under complementation for any 
complexity class 
$\mathcal{C}$ (the associated 
machines are deterministic and always halt, so the complementary machine just 
reverses which states are accepting), if 
$L\in\mathcal{P}^{\Sigma^p_i}\subseteq\Sigma^p_i$ then so is $\overline{L}$, 
and therefore $L\in\Pi^p_i$.



Unlike the arithmetical hierarchy, the polynomial hierarchy is not known to be proper.  Indeed, if $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{NP}$ then $\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{PH}$, so a proof that the hierarchy is proper would be quite significant.
