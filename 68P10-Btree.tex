\begin{document}
A \emph{B-tree of \PMlinkescapetext{order} $m$} is a \PMlinkname{balanced}{BalancedTree} search tree in 
which 
\begin{itemize}
\item
every node has at most $m$ children,
\item 
every node, other than a root or leaf, has at least $m/2$ children,
\item
the root has at least 2 children if it is not a leaf,
\item
all leaf nodes appear on the same level
\item
a nonleaf node with $k$ children has $k-1$ keys.
\end{itemize}


If the tree has $n$ nodes its height is $O(log_2(n))$.
