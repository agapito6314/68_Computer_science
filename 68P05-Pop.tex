Given a stack, the act of removing an element from the top of the stack is to \emph{pop} it off. If there is a stack pointer, it would be decremented (or incremented if the bottom element of the stack is placed at the highest memory address available).

To do this to a queue is usually called to \emph{dequeue}.
