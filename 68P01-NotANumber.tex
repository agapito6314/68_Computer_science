\begin{document}
In a computer, {\em not a number} (usually abbreviated {\em NaN}) indicates that an arithmetical operation has resulted in a value that is not a number understood (or representable) by the computer. Division by zero is one frequent cause of a result being NaN. Asking for the square root of a negative number is another operation that can result in NaN (unless the computer has been programmed to recognize imaginary numbers).

NaN is not a specific value that can be tested for with the usual comparison operators. The programmer is advised to test for NaN with a special function provided by the programming language (such as \verb=isNaN(x)= in JavaScript.

Generally, computer algebra systems do not report NaN results even if they do display an error message for a given operation.
